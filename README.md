Outcomes Analysis is used in a variety of ways including: 

creating solid outcome statements for your project brings many positive effects: 

Better planning: Outcome statements increase our visibility into the link between project tasks, outputs, and the desired beneficial effects. Identifying the full set of tasks and outputs that will  lead to project success gets easier, which facilitates better planning. 

Better evaluation: Outcome statements supports the measurement of progress towards the achievement  of beneficial effects that go beyond the delivery of project outputs. 

Risk reduction: When the desired outcomes are made explicit and agreed upon at the beginning of a  project, the execution team dramatically increases their control over project risks. This  control results in better on-time deliveries, fewer product quality programs, higher ROI. 
Knowing when to stop making improvements

Outcome statements can prevent organizations from incurring unnecessary costs and  misdirecting resources from real opportunities by continuing to make improvements  when the outcome is already satisfied, or even overserved.
