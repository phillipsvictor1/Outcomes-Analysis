# Outcome Analysis 

Achieving outcomes as a Business Analyst

Context

I was hired to set up a project in the area of pharmaceuticals and drug discovery. There were two main challenges that involved two different departments - Department A and B. 

Department A had the objective of designing therapeutic molecules, novel or early stage discovery molecules. The goal was to tie out data automatically that came from an assay registration system that was connected to a pipeline system. 

Needless to say, there were many moving parts like protocols, metadata etc. Based on the assay system the team wanted to capture readouts for scientists. 

Department B, had data everywhere. A sort of ‘hodgepodge’ of data on separate systems. 

Department A: The desired outcomes for scientists using an Assay Registration System

(Short term) Minimize errors in categorization of assays in original vs version. 

(Long term) Increase comfort in sharing ACCURATE data across different departments like protein chemistry, assay system, complex protein.

(Long-term) Increase in accuracy of labeling using the molecule registration system

(Long-term) Increased the scientists ability to discover, understand and consume assay data and what is done with the data. 

(Long-term) Increased the scientists ability to run data, extract data and visualize data. 


Build-Measure-Learn: 

There is no legacy system in place at this time. Although the new system will need to be set up in a way that is useful to its users. 

This Assay Registration System should allow the user to categorize, share, organize and manipulate the data. 

Accuracy seemed to be very important. One idea is to allow data privacy. A user could be granted permission to view or it could be made public when ready. 

Also, labeling can be ambiguous. Labeling in a way that is easy to understand would be helpful in making the system easier to use. 


Department B: The desired outcomes for scientists:

(Short term) None

(Medium term) Minimize the amount of disparate information within the department with a strategy. 

(Long term)  This is a new department so the solution will need to address the needs of the users. Mainly, information is disorganized and it is arriving from different sources. 

Determining exactly, what information needs to be presented and what the information will be used for would be ideal - organizing and making the information useful.
