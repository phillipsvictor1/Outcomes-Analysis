Example: Outcomes Analysis 

Segment 1 Opportunities: Scientist at Department 1

Minimize incorrect classification of assays

Minimize fear of sharing ACCURATE data in the across departments

Minimize ‘siloing’ of data that exists between different departments

Minimize the lack of accessibility and retrievability of assays


Assay Registration:
Assay Registration at Dept. 1,  Scientists at Dept 2 and 


Segment 2 Opportunities: Scientists at Department 2

Minimize and streamline disparate data including protocols, meta data, 

Minimize wasted time dealing with manual processes with automation

Minimize confusion about department processes consuming, discovering and understanding data

Minimize lack of understanding among scientists  over what they do with their data

Minimize time to complete assay projects
